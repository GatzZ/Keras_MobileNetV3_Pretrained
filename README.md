# Keras MobileNetV3 and load official pretrained weights

I modified [Keras MobilenetV3](https://github.com/xiaochus/MobileNetV3) to load official pretrained weights, and it may help you to implement your own MobileNetV3-based models.

So far, I only finished **MobilenetV3-Small**. If you need other variants, just try to modify the network in the notebook.
